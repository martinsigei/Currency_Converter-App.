The Currency Converter app is a simple yet powerful tool designed to help users easily convert between currencies, with a focus on converting USD to Kenyan Shillings. The app is built using Flutter, making it available on both Android and iOS devices.

## Key Features:
- **Real-Time Conversion**: Input an amount in USD, and the app instantly converts it to Kenyan Shillings (KES) with a single click.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The app features a clean and intuitive design. The main screen displays the converted amount prominently at the top, with a text input field for entering the amount in USD and a conversion button below.
- **Responsive Design**: The app's layout is designed to be responsive, ensuring a smooth user experience across different screen sizes.
## How It Works:
- **Enter Amount**: Users enter the amount in USD they wish to convert into the provided text field.
- **Convert**: By pressing the "Convert to Kenyan Shilling" button, the app calculates the equivalent value in KES using a predefined conversion rate (e.g., 1 USD = 127.81 KES).
- **View Result**: The converted amount is immediately displayed at the top of the screen, replacing the placeholder value.
This app is ideal for travelers, businesses, and anyone needing quick currency conversions between USD and KES. Its simplicity and efficiency make it a must-have tool for managing finances on the go.
